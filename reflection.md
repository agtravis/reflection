Part 1: Reflection
Reflect on what you have achieved so far in this course and answer the following questions:

The Journey so Far

_What have you learned so far?_
I came into this course with 90% of the knowledge as far as pretty much HW4, the programming quiz, and a smattering of ES6. This was all self taught over the year previous to commencing the course - I took this time deliberatly for this purpose and to save up to pay for the course. Over those few modules, I learned about CSS Frameworks, Flexbox, and a few new methods and functions here and there. The biggest challenge was mastering Git. My first real challenge came when it was time to implement 3rd party APIs, and with the exception of an intro to SQL, everything else has been new, challenging and rewarding. I don't need to list these topics individually, but the biggest thing I have learned is that I really do enjoy this learning, and it is most excellent to be using my brain for something challenging. I am also beginning to see how computer programming might be applied in a professional setting outside of a personal or business website.

_What have you accomplished?_
Fleshed out projects, including some full stack. An understanding of not just how, but why, and an ability to hold onto code information better inside my head. Being able to look at someone else's code and understand what is going on, and debugging just by reading sometimes.

_Think back to the first week, how have you changed and grown since then?_
I am a lot more empowered to achieve what I want. I am confident that I do have potential to achieve success in this field if I keep going. I also have more realistic expectations of how the industry might function.

Path to Success

_What are your goals for the remainder of the course?_
Mainly, to stay on track. I would like to do more interview questions. I learn by doing and repetition, so the more examples I see, the better. I also like knowing the underlying technology before using a tool that is designed to circumvent it - for example creating our own ORM before using Sequelize, and I assume Handlebars before React.

_What do you hope to accomplish before the course completes?_
To have the second and third projects be succesful. To continue learning.

_What do you hope to accomplish after the course completes?_
I mean ultimatley get a job, but I think I would like to do another course. Obviously more computer science knowledge would be useful, but I would also like to figure out what area I would like to end up in and be more specific and niche in that field - I suspect that will be in the field of data science since I absolutely love databases and SQL. I will need to wrap my head around sequelize better!

_What do you plan to do to ensure you accomplish these goals?_
Keep my head down, put in the hours, see the results! Take a break and a vacation after the course, but ABC - Always Be Coding!

_How do these plans and goals differ from the first half of the course?_
They haven't really, just got more specific. There was always a danger that through the course I might not have been able to cope, or just discovered I didn't enjoy coding, but that hasn't happened.
